I am a PhD student in computer science at [$$Ds^2 Lab$$](https://ds2-lab.github.io/) of the University of Virginia under Prof. [Yue Cheng](https://tddg.github.io/).

**Generally, I aim to develop high-performance, scalable systems for emerging ML applications.** Currently I am working on building better (computing and storage) systems for (distributed) ML applications. For example, rethinking the potential of multi-tier parallel processing within heterogeneous computing environments like CPU-GPU collaborative computing. 

Before joining UVA, I earned my bachelor's degree from Sichuan University, where I had the privilege of being guided by Prof. [Mingjie Tang](https://merlintang.github.io/) and Prof. [Hui Lu](https://huilucs.github.io/) from UTA, focusing on optimizing large-scale recommendation model training systems. I was also fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Jianguo Wang](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/csjgwang/) from Purdue University, with a focus on utilizing machine learning techniques to optimize graph algorithms' performance. 

I am open to other opportunities and new research, so please feel free to reach me at my email erc8gx@virginia.edu
